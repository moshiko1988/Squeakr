### Resources used
- Ruby on Rails

### Technologies
- Ember.js
- I used ember to create front end of the app.
- Ruby in Rails
- I used Ruby on Rails for the back end.
- postgreSQL
- I used postgreSQL to store the data of the app.

## General approach

When I started planning the app I was working on the wireframes and the user stories first. I made sure how the app relationships and resources should look like.

Then I worked on the back end to build the general stracture of the app and the relationships and then I started working on the front end, I choose to build the front end with ember.js.

## Installation instructions
- clone and install dependencies
- ```npm install && bower install```

## Squeakr to be

I am currently working on improving Squeakr by letting a user adding and posting pictures and follow other users.
